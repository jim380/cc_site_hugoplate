    bulletpoints:
      - "**Consistency** - As network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems, we prioritize consistency over availability due to the harsher penalty for inconsistency than unavailability"
      - "**Reliability** - We believe the basis of reliability is simplicity. Complication often ends up being over-promising and under-performing. What’s a good system if you can’t sufficiently maintain it?"
      - "**Resilience** - Security cannot be guaranteed but resilience can. We fully adapt the “Prevention, Detection and Response” approach standardized in the Information Security industry to mitigate risks"
      - "**Key Management** - We leverage HSM with full Ed25519 support in block signing"
      - "**DDoS Protection** - Geographically distributed sentry nodes are utilized to shift the burden of DDoS from the validator node(s), and can be quickly spun up or configured to mitigate the impact of existing attacks"
      - "**Monitoring** - We developed and maintain **Cendermint**, an integrated solution that combines monitoring and alerting"
